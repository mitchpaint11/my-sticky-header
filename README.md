# Coding Challenge

## Objective
Create a simple single-page app with the following features:
- A header bar that remains sticky at the top of the page on load and when scrolling up.
- The header hides out of view when scrolling down.
- A toggle option within the header that allows the user to keep the header always visible, overriding the default scroll behavior.

## Requirements
The solution should utilize the following technologies:
- **Next.js** (with pages router)
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **TypeScript**

## Expected Output
A single-page application that demonstrates:
- An understanding of the specified behavior for the header bar.
- Appropriate use of **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **TypeScript** to meet the technical requirements.
  
## Installation and Setup
To run the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
